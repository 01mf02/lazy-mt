# lazy-mt

This crate provides multi-threaded lazy evaluation for Rust.
It is an adaptation of the [lazy](https://github.com/reem/rust-lazy) crate,
making it compatible with newer Rust versions.
For single-threaded lazy evaluation, please consider using
the [lazy-st](https://github.com/01mf02/lazy-st/) crate
for higher performance.
